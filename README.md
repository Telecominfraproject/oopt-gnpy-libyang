# Opinionated Python bindings for the `libyang` library

Python bindings and packaging of [`libyang`](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang).
We're focusing on parsing, validating and accessing YANG-modeled JSON data trees.
Essentially, just enough to get [`gnpy`](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/oopt-gnpy) going.
Want more?
Patches welcome.
